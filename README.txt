The Space Weather Prediction Center records data related to the interactions between the sun and the Earth's geomagnetic field. This project aims to explore the ability to predict the value of the solar radio flux using observations of the number of sunspots on the surface of the sun and the number of solar flares that are observed daily.


The details about the dataset can be found below:
Typically, the solar radio flux is measured with instrumentation at a wavelength of 10.7 cm. The flux is always a positive value.
